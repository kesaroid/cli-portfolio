### Docker Usage

First, clone the project and edit `config.json` to your liking. Then run the following to start the container in the background:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

If you **know** what you were doing, you can also try changing `Dockerfile` & `docker-compose.yml`!
Learn more about Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/ 'here').


### Themes

You can find several pre-configured themes in `themes.json`, and you can replace the colors in `config.json` with the theme color you like! The themes are based on the themes on [this website](https://glitchbone.github.io/vscode-base16-term/#/).

For a better preview of the themes, checkout the images in the `demo` folder.

### Favicons

Favicons are located in `public/`, along with the other files you may want to upload to your website. I used this [website](https://www.favicon-generator.org/) to generate favicons.

### Banner

You may also want to change the output of the `banner` command. To do that, simply paste your generated banner in `src/utils/bin/commands.ts`. I used this [website](https://manytools.org/hacker-tools/ascii-banner/) to generate my banner.

### Advanced Configuration

If you want to further customize your page, feel free to change the source code to your liking!

## üåê Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy a Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/) from the creators of Next.js.

You can install `vercel` cli and follow the instruction [here](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/overview).

You can also connect your github account to vercel and have vercel automatically deploy the github repository for you.
